It is built on the **Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) framework**, specifically tailored for biological applications. The model is hosted on the **Hugging Face Hub**, making it easily accessible for researchers and developers working with biological image data.\n",

        "BioCLIP is designed to bridge the gap between visual data and semantic understanding in biological research. Its main applications include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Automated Species Identification**: Extracting meaningful features from images of fungi, plants, or animals to assist in species recognition.\n",
        "- **Biodiversity Monitoring**: Enabling large-scale ecological studies by processing images from camera traps or field surveys.\n",
        "- **Medical and Microscopy Analysis**: Supporting tasks like cell classification, pathology slide analysis, and disease detection.\n",

        "- **Pretrained on Biological Datasets**: Unlike general-purpose CLIP models, BioCLIP has been fine-tuned on biological image datasets, improving its performance in domain-specific tasks.\n",
        "- **Feature Extraction for Downstream Tasks**: Generates robust, high-dimensional embeddings that can be used for classification, clustering, or retrieval.\n",
        "- **L2-Normalized Embeddings**: Ensures that extracted feature vectors have unit length, making them suitable for similarity comparisons.\n",
        "- **Seamless Integration with PyTorch**: Designed to work within PyTorch-based workflows for machine learning and deep learning applications.\n",

        "- **Embedding Handling**: Adds precomputed embeddings to the dataset and allows retrieval of embeddings for specific classes.\n",
        "- **Data Access**: Implements the `__getitem__()` method to fetch images, class IDs, and file paths. It also returns embeddings if available.\n",
        "- **Class Mapping**: Maps class IDs to species names and allows retrieving the category of samples by ID.\n",
        "- **Sample Visualization**: Provides the `show_sample()` method to display images along with their class labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Functions:\n",
        "- **`add_embeddings(embeddings)`**: Merges new embeddings with the dataset.\n",
        "- **`get_embeddings_for_class(id)`**: Retrieves embeddings for a given class ID.\n",
        "- **`_get_df(data_path, split)`**: Loads the dataset metadata into a pandas DataFrame.\n",
        "- **`__getitem__(idx)`**: Fetches a sample by index, including image, category ID, and embedding (if available).\n",
        "- **`__len__()`**: Returns the total number of samples in the dataset.\n",
        "- **`get_class_id(idx)`**: Retrieves the class ID for a specific sample.\n",
        "- **`show_sample(idx)`**: Displays an image with its associated class label.\n"

        "1. **Initialize the Model**: The code sets up the **BioCLIP** model on the available device (GPU if available, else CPU). The model is then loaded and set to evaluation mode (`model.eval()`).\n",

        "   - The `generate_embeddings()` function loops through all the samples in the dataset.\n",
        "   - For each image, it extracts the feature embeddings using `model.extract_features()`.\n",
        "   - The extracted embeddings are stored in a pandas DataFrame with the image filename.\n",
        "3. **Add Embeddings to Dataset**: The generated embeddings are then added to the respective dataset (`test_dataset` and `train_dataset`) using the `add_embeddings()` method.\n",

        "- **BioCLIP model**: Used to extract embeddings for each image in the dataset.\n",
        "- **Data Handling**: `im_names` stores image filenames, and `embs` stores the corresponding embeddings.\n",

        "\n",
        "This code defines a **Nearest Neighbor (NN) Classifier** that uses precomputed embeddings to make predictions by comparing them to class prototypes. It employs **cosine similarity** to match test embeddings with training embeddings, making it suitable for few-shot and embedding-based classification tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Classifier Initialization**:\n",
        "   - The `NNClassifier` class is initialized with the training embeddings and sets up a similarity search index using **FAISS** (Facebook AI Similarity Search).\n",
        "   - The `build_index()` method creates an index for efficient similarity searches based on the cosine similarity between embeddings.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Making Predictions**:\n",
        "   - The `make_prediction()` method computes the similarity between each test embedding and the stored class prototypes. It returns the predicted class labels (`cls`) and confidence scores (`conf`) based on the similarity values.\n",
        "   - **FAISS** is used to search the nearest prototypes for each test embedding.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Generating Predictions for the Test Dataset**:\n",
        "   - After initializing the classifier, predictions are made for the **test dataset** using the `make_prediction()` method.\n",
        "   - Predicted labels are added to the test dataset (`test_dataset.df[\"preds\"]`).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Submission Generation**:\n",
        "   - The predictions are grouped by `observationID` and formatted as a space-separated string of class IDs.\n",
        "   - The predictions are saved to a CSV file for submission.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Components:\n",
        "- **FAISS**: Efficiently computes nearest neighbor search using cosine similarity.\n",
        "- **Embedding-based Classification**: The model leverages precomputed embeddings for each sample and matches them to class prototypes.\n",
        "- **Prediction Confidence**: The similarity values serve as confidence scores for each prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach is effective for embedding-based classification tasks where models make predictions based on the similarity of embeddings to predefined class prototypes.\n"

        "\n",
        "The `PrototypeClassifier` is a PyTorch model designed for **embedding-based classification** using **prototype-based classification**. It learns the class prototypes by averaging the embeddings of each class and uses cosine similarity to classify new embeddings based on their proximity to the prototypes.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization**:\n",
        "   - The model is initialized with a **train dataset** and computes class prototypes using embeddings of each class.\n",
        "   - The `class_prototypes` are stored as **non-trainable parameters** (`requires_grad=False`), representing the average embeddings of each class.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Embedding Retrieval**:\n",
        "   - The `_get_classifier_embeddings()` method retrieves the embeddings for each class in the training dataset.\n",
        "   - If a class has no embeddings, a zero vector is used as a placeholder for that class.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Prototype Computation**:\n",
        "   - The `get_prototypes()` method computes the **prototype** for each class by averaging its embeddings. These prototypes serve as the central representation of each class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Prediction**:\n",
        "   - The `make_prediction()` method calculates the cosine similarity between each input embedding and all class prototypes.\n",
        "   - The predicted class (`cls`) is the one with the highest similarity, and the prediction confidence (`conf`) is derived from the maximum softmax probability over the similarities.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Components:\n",
        "- **Class Prototypes**: Each class is represented by its average embedding, which acts as the class prototype.\n",
        "- **Cosine Similarity**: The model uses cosine similarity to compare input embeddings with class prototypes and determine the predicted class.\n",
        "- **Prediction Confidence**: The confidence is computed using the softmax of the cosine similarity values, providing a measure of certainty for each prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "This classifier is well-suited for tasks where class prototypes (average embeddings) can effectively represent the classes, and it works well with embedding-based models for few-shot or metric learning tasks.\n"
